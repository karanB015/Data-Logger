### Sensors:-

- Accelerometer:- Basically, an accelerometer being an mems(micro-electro mechanical system) device used to measure acceleration forces. 
Such forces may be static, like the continuous force of gravity or, as is the case with many mobile devices, dynamic to sense movement
or vibrations.

For this project, i have used MPU-6050(shown below), a relatively cheap board considering a fact that it contains accelerometer and gyroscope both. It contains a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro in a breakout board. It is very accurate, as it contains 16-bits analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel. Therefor it captures the x, y, and z channel at the same time. The sensor uses the I2C-bus to interface with the Arduino.
