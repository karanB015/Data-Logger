## Data-Logger
Basically, a device to log run time data via provided sensor network of any heavy duty machine or automobile etc. This project have been developed using arduino, raspberry pi and various sensors like MPU-6050, wind rev P, Inductive Proximity etc.

Here, we are aquiring the filtered sensor data from various parts of the automobile, to validate the design and make improvements in future work.
Here, i will be uploading all the raw files of fully descreptive Arduino C and python codes
